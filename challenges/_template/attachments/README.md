# Attacments

## Local Files

Local file size limit:

- On git tree: <= 512 KiB
- On LFS: <= 10 MiB
- Use other ways to share files if they are bigger than the limits.

You should put here all the files here to be zipped and sent to the participants.

## Remote Files

You should put here the only one link to the remote files.

## Action Generated Files

If you use the action to generate files, you should use `../build/pre-build.sh` or `../build/post-build.sh` to generate the files and put them here.

Use the following command to copy the files to the attachments folder:

```bash
cp -av build/... attachments/
```

**NOTE: DO NOT COPY THIS MARKDOWN FILE TO THE CHALLENGE FOLDER. IT IS ONLY A TEMPLATE FOR THE ATTACHMENTS FOLDER.**
